# Audio visualizer project

Just a small experiment/tool project to get a custom to nodeJS and other technologies revolving around JavaScript.

## Starting the nodeJS server
You can use the default
```sh
node index.js
```
or alternatively you can use nodemon
- Note that the server does restart once a file is saved 
```sh
nodemon .
```
